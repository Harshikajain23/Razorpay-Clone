# Razorpay UI Clone

This project is a clone of an **older version of Razorpay’s website UI**, built completely using **HTML** and **TailwindCSS**.

I wrote **1500+ lines of code** from scratch to recreate the layout, components, and responsiveness — without relying on AI tools.  
It helped me strengthen my frontend skills and gain deeper confidence in building websites independently.
